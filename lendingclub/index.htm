  <h1>Never lend money to these people!</h1>
  <h4>by Alexander Trentin</h4><p>
It makes sense to look for the demographic group if someone asks you for money. Data from peer-to-peer lender LendingClub shows that the differences in probability of default or late payment can be substantial.</p>
 <p><a href="interactive.htm">Here you can check</a> if you would give a loan to somebody like yourself. Check different demographic criteria and how they make it more or less likely that somebody will run into problems paying back a loan.</p>
<h3>Don't lend to people from these States</h3><p>
Loans taken out by people living in South Dakota show a probability of getting into problems which is twice as high as loans taken out by people living in New England.</p>
<h4>Problem rate by state</h4>
<img src="states.png" width=100%>
<h3>Don't lend to people with short employment length</h3>
<p>The shorter people are employed in their current job, the higher the probability that their loans will run into problems.</p>
<h4>Problem rate by employment history</h4>
<img src="emp_length_short.png" width=80%>
<h3>Don't lend to people with short credit history</h3><p>
People who got their first credit limit approved more recently have a higher probability not to pay back their loans.</p>
<h4>Problem rate by years of credit history</h4>

<h3>Don't lend to people who want to consolidate debt</h3><p>
Surprisingly, people who want to consolidate debt are more likely to default on their loans. The lowest risk is exhibited by borrowers who want to pay back credit card debt.</p>
<h4>Problem rate by loan purpose</h4>
<img src="purpose.png" width=80%<p>
<h3>Don't lend to poor people</h3><p>
The higher the income, the lower is the probability that a loan will not be paid back.</p>
<h4>Problem rate by income quartile</h4>
<img src="quartile.png" width=80%>
<h3>Grouping people by demographic criteria</h3>
<p>The differences in the probability of problematic loans are much higher, if people are grouped by demographic criteria. Over a thousand different groups are estimated, using Zip codes, income quartile, loan purpose, length of credit history and length of employment. Only groups with more than 100 people is taken into account.</p>
<p>The group with the highest risk will have problems paying back a loan with a probability of more than 20%. While the group with the lowest risk runs into problems with a probability less than 1%.</p>
