  <h1>Never lend money to these people!</h1>
  <h4>by Alexander Trentin</h4><br>
It makes sense to look for the demographic group if someone asks you for money. Data from peer-to-peer lender LendingClub shows that the differences in probability of default or late payment can be substantial.<br><br>
<h4>Never lend to people from the South</h4>
Loans of people in South Carolina have a double as high probability of getting into problems than loans of people in New England.<br><br>

<h4>Never lend to people with low employment length</h4>
The lower people are employed in their current job, the higher the probability that their loans will run into problems.<br><br>

<h4>Never lend to people with short credit history</h4>
People who got their first credit limit approved more recently have a higher probability not to pay back their loans.<br><br>

<h4>Never lend to people who want to consolidate debt</h4>
Surprisingly, people who want to consolidate debt are more likely to default on their loans. The lowest risk are borrowers who want to pay back credit card debt.<br><br>

<h4>Never lend to people to poor people</h4>
The higher the income, the lower is the probability that a loan will not be paid back.<br><br>

<h4>Group people by demographic criteria</h4>
The differences are much higher, if all the demographic criteria are grouped to classify people according to their probability if they pack their loans.<br><br>
